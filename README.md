# CSS &amp; JavaScript Tutorial 3: Multiple clients one multi-themed multi-page template

Video tutorial is here: https://youtu.be/oJh1ZAaqaRQ

Watch as I write a static page that hosts multiple clients on one template. This is a single page JavaScript application hat gives the illusion of multiple pages by dynamically calling data and updating the DOM in realtime. 
This tutorial will be an example of a baseball league website where each team gets it's own theme and content, images, text, videos, endpoints etc...

Demo of different teams using the same template:
